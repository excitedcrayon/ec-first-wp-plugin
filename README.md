# ec-first-wp-plugin
This is a custom Wordpress plugin I built to extend the functionality of the Intranet at work.

## Functionality
The plugin was designed with simplicity to perform the following actions
- Create a custom table in the Wordpress database.
- Display all entries in a sort and search table using DataTables (JQuery).
- Allow the end user to create an entry.
- View/Edit an entry.
- Export all available entries to a CSV file.

## Admin Panel 
- Upload data to the table using a CSV file.
- Export and backup entries from table into a CSV file.

## Permissions and User Access
- Use the custom shortcode [insert_contracts] with parameters and attributes to control which user level access (admin, editor, subscriber) and/or user login can view and access the entries table.
